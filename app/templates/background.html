    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        This page provides some background on the analysis ready data (ARD) products which have been
        produced and the visualisations of those products used on this site.
    </p>

    <h3>Projection and Coordinate System</h3>
    <p>
        All data from this analysis has been reprojected to the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnance_Survey_National_Grid">Ordnance Survey National Grid</a>
        (<a href="https://epsg.io/27700">EPSG:27700</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Landsat</h3>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov">Landsat program</a> offers the longest continuous global record of
        the Earthâ€™s surface; it continues to deliver visually stunning and scientifically valuable images of our planet.
    </p>
    <p>
        For Wales, this system has made available the full archive of Landsat 4 TM, Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+ and
        Landsat 8 OLI of scenes with less than 95 % cloud. The earliest image was from 5th January 1985.
    </p>
    <p>
        All the landsat scenes have come from the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat/landsat-collection-1">
        USGS Collection 1</a> archive and has been processed to a spatial resolution of 30 metres (i.e., each pixel
        represents a 30 x 30 m area on the ground).
    </p>

    <h3>Sentinel-1</h3>
    <p>
        The ESA <a href="https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1">Sentinel-1</a> mission comprises a
        constellation of two polar-orbiting satellites, operating day and night performing C-band synthetic aperture
        radar (SAR) imaging, enabling them to acquire imagery regardless of the weather.
    </p>

    <h3>Sentinel-2</h3>
    <p>
        The ESA/Copernicus <a href="https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2">Sentinel-2</a> mission
        comprises a constellation of two polar-orbiting satellites placed in the same sun-synchronous orbit, phased
        at 180&deg; to each other. It aims at monitoring variability in land surface conditions, and its wide swath
        width (290 km) and high revisit time (10 days at the equator with one satellite, and 5 days with 2 satellites
        under cloud-free conditions which results in 2-3 days at mid-latitudes) will support monitoring of Earth's
        surface changes. The coverage limits are from between latitudes 56&deg; south and 84&deg; north.
